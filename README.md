## Setting up project on your computer

Download or clone this repository, open it in terminal and run:

Linux:

    chmod +x just_installed.sh
    ./just_installed.sh

Windows:

    just_installed.bat

This script is going to install all libraries you need, ask you to create a
superuser, then run the server.
If you have already set up the repository, setup.sh and setup.bat scripts are
going to be usefull: automatically make migrations, migrate and run the server:

Linux:

    chmod +x setup.sh
    ./setup.sh

Windows:

    setup.bat

**Attention! Your environment need to be set up so python3 is launched using 'python' command.**
