This documentation describes API and code of [diary for students](https://diary56.ru).
As you see, despite the fact that this diary was made for Russians only, we are writing
this documentation in English with hope it's not going to be a big problem.

For some people, especially who are not living in Russia, the idea of diary can be
a little bit strange. In our system of education, every student has a record book with
his/her marks. These books are getting more and more useless and recently they've been
replaced by e-diaries - systems for storing and managing marks of students by their teachers.
